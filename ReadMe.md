## Using Postman to Interact with the Flask Endpoint

You can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to send HTTP requests to your Flask app running on `localhost:5000/process`. Follow these steps to interact with the endpoint using Postman:

1. **Download and Install Postman:** If you haven't already, download and install Postman from the [official website](https://www.postman.com/).

2. **Launch Postman:** Open Postman on your computer.

3. **Create a New Request:**
   - Click on the "New" button in Postman to create a new request.
   - Give your request a name (e.g., "Flask Endpoint Request").

4. **Set the Request Type:**
   - In the request tab, select the HTTP request type you want to send (POST).

5. **Specify the Request URL:**
   - Enter the URL for your Flask endpoint, which is `http://localhost:5000/process`.

6. **Add Parameters (if needed):**
   - If your Flask endpoint requires any query parameters or request body data, make sure to add them in the appropriate sections in Postman.
   - For JSON data, follow these steps:
     - Select the "Body" tab in Postman.
     - Choose the "raw" option.
     - Enter your JSON data in the request body.

This allows you to include JSON data in the request body when testing your Flask endpoint in Postman.

7. **Send the Request:**
   - Click the "Send" button to send the HTTP request to your Flask app.

8. **View the Response:**
   - Postman will display the response from your Flask app, allowing you to see the data or results returned by the endpoint.

By following these steps, you can easily test and interact with your Flask endpoint using Postman. This is especially useful for debugging and verifying the functionality of your API.
